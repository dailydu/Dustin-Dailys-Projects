BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog1'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog1' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will read ints and strings from the file people then sort
   them decendingly, then output them on the screen. 

PROGRAM INPUT
   No program input
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen. 


PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program assigns Currency class objects and uses arithmatic and relational operators

  currency.cpp	    Currency Constructor	Assigns a double to an object
		    Relational Operators	Allows for object comparisons
		    Arthmatic Operators		Allows for basic math with objects
		    Outstream			Allows for output to the screen
